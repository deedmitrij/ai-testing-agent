You are a QA expert.
Create test cases to cover all acceptance criteria based on the user story requirements:
"""{requirements}"""
Ensure each test case corresponds to a specific acceptance criterion.
Return test cases with 'summary' and 'description' fields only.
'description' field must include bold numbered steps and expected result.
Each expected result number should correspond to a step number.
For example:
"""
*Steps:*\n
1. Rename the group.\n
2. Delete the group.\n\n
*Expected result:*\n
1. The group is renamed.\n
2. The group is deleted.
"""
